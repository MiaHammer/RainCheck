(0:20 - Desk)
	I need to pay close attention to their actions so I’m ready for anything.
I’m not sure what exactly I can do when I see them moving, but at least I’ll be aware of it and my instincts will guide me to safety.
	… Or something like that.
	…
	!
	They jumped my fence.
	They have stepped on the front garden.
	I don’t want to pop my head out, I couldn’t see where they went after that.
	…
	This feels like when I witness a giant spider or lizard crawling into a corner of my house, or behind the curtains at night.
	I cannot stand being in the same vicinity as those creatures. They completely break the peace and any illusion of personal space by just existing, with me knowing they might, or might not, still be there.
	And the idea that those creatures could just jump on top of me at any second, from outside my field of view, if they so desired?
	It is pure agony. It makes me unable to sleep at night.
	This feels similar, yet much worse.
	Whoever that is, they clearly seem to despise me.
	Can I really think of nobody that would feel that way?
	…

	I’d rather not talk about this.
Just…
Leave.
Me.
Alone.

Bad End 2.
