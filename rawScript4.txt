(0:20 - Garage)
M: “My best shot is going to Annie’s for the night.”
I ran down the stairs to the hallway, and then to the garage.
I pulled out my phone and messaged Annie to let her know I’m coming:
M: ”Annie, I think I’d feel safer sleeping at your place tonight, is that ok?”
…
She’s taking a minute to respond.
I feel selfishly like I deserved a more instant response at this time…
But eventually:
A: “Yes, that’s fine! Just be careful.”
M: “Ok, will do.”
Then I grabbed my helmet and rode off.
